# Mixed Analog and Digital VLSI Final Project - Temperature Sensor

#### About 

For the MADVLSI (Mixed Analog-Digital VLSI) Spring 2021 Final Project, we set out to build a temperature sensor packed with switched capacitors and a Sigma-Delta Modulator. Not knowing what we got ourselves into, we spent countless hours trying to address various technical and PDK challenges when trying to implement everything including large arrays of switched capacitor based circuits. Realizing the challenges for first-timers like us, we scaled our project back to a temperature sensor built with a switched capacitor bandgap reference and a dual slope Analog to Digital Converter. Here in this report, we present our schematic design and layouts for this dual slope ADC-based temperature sensor.
